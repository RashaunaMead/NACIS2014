# Overarching Principles


###Give users control:

+ Following minimalist instruction 

+ Users often are excited to jump in and explore the interface, so allow them to do that.

+ Limiting the ability to dismiss or skip learning materials will annoy and frustrate them, hindering learning.

<img width='50px' src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/media-p.slid.es/uploads/rmead/images/578016/icons_Rocket.png' >
1/11

###Enable access at anytime:

+ It is important to let the user access learning materials at anytime

+ Control for accessing them should be clearly marked in the interface.

<img width='50px' src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/media-p.slid.es/uploads/rmead/images/578017/icons_Time.png'>
2/11

###Internal integration can be powerful:

+ First time<span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255); text-align:left"> users will benefit from an emphasis on internally embedded learning</span>

+ Internal integration is efficient and provides learning in context

+ Reduces the cognitive load and improves memorability 

<img width='50px' src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/media-p.slid.es/uploads/rmead/images/578019/icons_browser.png'>
3/11

###Chunk information:

+ Memorability is improved by breaking up instructional content

+ Allows users to find the information they need more quickly


4/11

<img width='50px' src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/media-p.slid.es/uploads/rmead/images/578021/icons_chunk.png'>


###Restrict domain knowledge for novices

+ Too much <span style="text-align:left">domain  knowledge </span>in quantity and times offered can be become overwhelming.   

+ Provide pragmatic knowledge in subtle, non-intrusive ways and avoid impeding the user's workflow


5/11

<img width='50px' src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/media-p.slid.es/uploads/rmead/images/578023/icons_book.png'>


###Support non-linear learning:

+ Mapmaking is often not a linear process

+ Linear instruction can impede exploration and active learning

+ Organize learning materials by subject first then linearly if need be

6/11

<img width='50px' src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/media-p.slid.es/uploads/rmead/images/578024/icons_linear.png'>



###All users are different:

+ Users have different learning styles, preferences, and levels of domain knowledge

+ One type of media format or type of learning material that will work for everyone

+ Leverage multiple media format and types of learning materials in combination to support a wider range of users.

<img width='50px' src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/media-p.slid.es/uploads/rmead/images/578028/icons_User.png'>


###Make searching easy:

+ Searchability is valued because it allows users to quickly find the specific information for which they are looking

+ Provide text when possible alongside multimedia learning materials 

+ Provide a search function

8/11

<img width='50px' src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/media-p.slid.es/uploads/rmead/images/578029/icons_search.png'>
###Use consistent vocabulary:

+ Users first must acquire semantic knowledge before they know how to search for types of knowledge

+ Vocabulary should be consistent across the neocartographic interface and all provided learning materials

9/11

<img width='50px' src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/media-p.slid.es/uploads/rmead/images/578031/icons_Learning.png'>

###Design two kinds of feedback:

1) Critical feedback: Errors that ‘break the map’

+ Are essential and can stop the users workflow

+ Should be clear on how to fix the error

2) Feedback about cartographic design decisions

+  Should be given in a subtle way

+ Offered as a suggestion, rather than correction

10/11
<img width='50px' src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/media-p.slid.es/uploads/rmead/images/578035/icons_feedback2.png'>

###Support active learning:

+ Learning by doing, or active learning, is the primary method by which a user will learn an interface

+  Design the interface to allow users see immediate successes within the interface 

+ Provide learning materials that support the tasks that they are trying to complete

- Include a search function

- Organized and Structured 

- Support chunking of info with “bite-sized” paragraphs

- Integrate multimedia

###Pro

- Searchable
- Good for in-depth support

- Keep it short 

- Exit and recall clearly marked

- Limit to the first few uses

### Pro
- Interactive tours perform well because they internally show users where things are in the context that people will actually be using the tools
- Provides an entry point for using the interface
- Lightens the cognitive load, as user does not have to exit the interface to learn material, then remember what was learned upon return to the interface

### Con
- Can prevent work
- Can annoy the user
- Usually in a sequential format, but mapmaking is not always sequential 

## Tutorial

- Bite size, multiple connected tutorials</span> rather than one long one

- Embed simple first step tutorials into the interface when possible
- Include</span> final examples 

- Example galleries work well for expert or reoccurring users 

### Pro
- Effectively supports semantic knowledge, the name and location of tools
- Establishes a common language

### Con
- Expert users may become frustrated if they have to muddle through material that they already know to to get to a segment that they are interested in
- Takes time and investment

# Should domain knowledge of cartographic principles be supported in neocartographic interfaces?

- Realize not everyone wants or has the time to become experts in cartography
- Smart interfaces and or brewers can be an excellent way to support domain knowledge
- Support learning opportunities by providing domain knowledge, when possible

## Limitations &amp; Future Directions 


- Sample size

- UW-Madison connection

- Expert perceptions

+ User focus groups  

+ Qualitative and quantitative research, testing design recommendations
